        <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>Promote sisterhood, scholarship, leadership, and Asian American awareness in the University and in the community, while encouraging the expression of the individual. The sorority is composed of highly motivated women with diverse backgrounds, interests, and fields of study. Each woman, however, shares a strong bond of love, friendship, and sisterhood. With a supportive network of sisters, each woman can strive to fulfill her personal, academic, and career goals.</p>
        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to provide sisterhood among women, scholarship, leadership and Asian awareness in the University and community. Further, to provide a support group for those in their times of need and to encourage the making of successful women.</p>
        <h1>National History</h1>
        <p>alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established at the University of California at Berkeley in the Fall of 1989 and was recognized by the College Panhellenic Association on February 7, 1990. The founding sisters - Susan Kim, Fannie Pon, Jill Yoshimura, and Reina Yuan - dedicated themselves to establishing a strong and lasting organization which would provide Asian American women the opportunity to participate in the Greek system. Soon after being recognized by the College Panhellenic Association the founding sisters brought together a diverse group of women who shared with them the goals of sisterhood, scholarship, and leadership. These ideals were to later set the foundation for alpha Kappa Delta Phi's purpose.<br><br>
        The love and generosity that each member had for the organization was instrumental to the growth of alpha Kappa Delta Phi's reputation as a sorority, as well as to the forging of unbreakable friendships. The sisterhood has since then spread to prominent university campuses across the country. To meet the needs of the growing sisterhood, the National Board of alpha Kappa Delta Phi was established in May of 1993 at the National Convention in Santa Barbara, California.<br><br>
        It is the sincere wish of the founding sisters and the charter class that alpha Kappa Delta Phi continue to promote Asian Awareness in the community and leadership opportunities for women by providing each women with the resources, unique sisterly support and understanding to achieve her goals in life.</p>
        <h1>CMU Colony Founding</h1>
        <p>In the fall of 2002, a group of ambitious, unique, and hard-working women came together on the Carnegie Mellon University campus to form an interest group for a nationally recognized Asian Pacific American interest sorority. The interest group's ultimate dream was to establish a new chapter of alpha Kappa Delta Phi at their university that would welcome all women on campus who wished to enjoy the bonds of sisterhood, thus naming themselves L.A.D.I.E.S. - Love and Devotion in Eternal Sisterhood. The women came from various backgrounds and interests: An executive board member of a student organization, a philanthropic member of the community, an athlete, an artist, in addition to many other functions by which each girl represents herself. Although the differences between the women were noticeable, with every minute spent with one another, each woman became more and more convinced that it was as though the group was meant to meet. Each lady represented a separate piece of a puzzle, which when combined with the other pieces, formed a single solid entity with the same goal and purpose. Sisterhood, leadership, scholarship, service, and Asian awareness in the University and beyond were among the objectives L.A.D.I.E.S. constantly strove to achieve and promote.</p>
